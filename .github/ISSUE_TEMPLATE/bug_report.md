Right now, you're opening an issue to report a bug in Jupyter Notebook.

Please answer the following questions for yourself before submitting an issue
- [ ] I checked the documentation and found no answer
- [ ] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed
- [ ] I'm reporting the issue to the correct repository

If you have further questions after reading below, please visit the Jupyter Notebook discourse channel (https://discourse.jupyter.org/) and submit your questions there. There are many more people in the Jupyter community that engage on that channel.

NOTE:
Jupyter Notebook 6.x development is in maintenance-only mode. Bugs found in Notebook 6.x and that don't reproduce in Notebook 7.x may not get fixed.

Work in this repository is focused on Jupyter Notebook 7.x, the former RetroLab project. The code base for Notebook 7.x is very different than Notebook 6.x. If you can, please try reproducing Notebook 6.x bugs with Notebook 7.x using the main branch of this repository.

We recommend that you check out JupyterLab (https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), Jupyter's next generation Notebook interface.

Here, we're looking for specific bugs in the Jupyter Notebook codebase. If you think you've identified such a bug, you can continue opening your issue here. We'd appreciate if you include as much detail as possible, such as links to the offending code, snapshots of the UI issue, code blocks with your console logs, etc.
